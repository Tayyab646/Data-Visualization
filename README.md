🌸 Iris Dataset — Data Exploration & Visualization

This project focuses on exploring and visualizing the Iris dataset, one of the most famous datasets in machine learning.
The goal is to learn how to load, inspect, understand, and visualize data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this task is to:

✔ Load the Iris dataset
✔ Explore dataset structure and characteristics
✔ Understand trends and patterns
✔ Visualize relationships between features
✔ Identify value distributions and potential outliers

This helps build a strong foundation in data exploration (EDA).

📂 Dataset Used

Iris Dataset
A well-known dataset containing:

Feature	Description
sepal_length	Length of the sepal (cm)
sepal_width	Width of the sepal (cm)
petal_length	Length of the petal (cm)
petal_width	Width of the petal (cm)
species	Iris flower species

You can load it from seaborn, or use a CSV file.

🛠 Skills Practiced

Data loading with Pandas

Dataset inspection and summary statistics

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Plotting using Matplotlib

Visualization using Seaborn

Understanding relationships between features

Detecting outliers through box plots

📘 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Load the Dataset

Imported pandas and seaborn

Loaded the Iris dataset into a DataFrame

2️⃣ Inspect the Dataset

Checked the shape of the dataset

Displayed column names

Printed the first 5 rows with .head()

Used .info() and .describe() for summary statistics

3️⃣ Visualizations

📌 Scatter Plots
Used to show relationships between pairs of features (e.g., petal length vs petal width).

📌 Histograms
Used to understand value distributions for each feature.

📌 Box Plots
Used to check for outliers and spread of data.

Plots were created using:

matplotlib.pyplot

seaborn

📊 Example Visualizations Created

Pairwise scatter plots

Feature histograms

Box plots for all numeric columns
