# 🌸 Iris Dataset — Data Exploration & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and visualization of the **Iris dataset**, one of the most widely used datasets in machine learning and data science.

The objective is to develop a strong understanding of how to **load, inspect, analyze, and visualize data** using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are to:

* Load the Iris dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
* Explore the structure and key characteristics of the dataset
* Identify trends, patterns, and relationships between features
* Visualize feature distributions and comparisons
* Detect potential outliers using statistical plots

This project helps build a solid foundation in **data exploration and visualization techniques**.

## 📂 Dataset Used

### Iris Dataset

A well-known dataset containing measurements of iris flowers across three species.

| Feature      | Description              |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| sepal_length | Length of the sepal (cm) |
| sepal_width  | Width of the sepal (cm)  |
| petal_length | Length of the petal (cm) |
| petal_width  | Width of the petal (cm)  |
| species      | Iris flower species      |

The dataset can be loaded directly using **Seaborn** or from a CSV file.

## 📘 Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Load the Dataset

* Imported required libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn
* Loaded the Iris dataset into a DataFrame

---

### 2️⃣ Inspect the Dataset

* Checked dataset shape and dimensions
* Displayed column names
* Viewed sample records using `.head()`
* Used `.info()` and `.describe()` for summary statistics

---

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization

Various plots were created to analyze the dataset visually:

#### 📌 Scatter Plots

* Used to observe relationships between feature pairs
* Example: petal length vs petal width

#### 📌 Histograms

* Used to understand the distribution of values for each feature

#### 📌 Box Plots

* Used to analyze data spread and identify potential outliers

All visualizations were created using:

* `matplotlib.pyplot`
* `seaborn`

---

## 📊 Example Visualizations Created

* Pairwise scatter plots
* Feature-wise histograms
* Box plots for all numerical features
